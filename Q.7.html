    <h1>Monal</h1>
    <p>Sitting on top of the Potohar, nestled against the pristine Margallas, and looking over the plains of Peshawar and Lahore, the brick and mortar of Islamabad may be modern, but its culture and traditions are embedded in the centuries of our history that have unfolded between the ranges of Khyber and Bolan and the valley of Mehran.
